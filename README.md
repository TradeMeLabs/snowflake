## Contributions

Please see [Medium's growth framework for contributions](https://github.com/Medium/snowflake). You are welcome to fork and adjust our version as you would like.

## Installation

From Medium...

Get yarn if you donâ€™t have it already:

`npm install -g yarn`

Install dependencies:

`yarn`

### Running the dev server

`yarn dev`

### Building

#### OPTION ONE

`./build.sh`

NB: you may need to `chmod 755 build.sh` first.


#### OPTION TWO

Compose the constants file from the new data:
`python snowflake-csv-to-js.py`
`cat constants1.js trackdata.js constants2.js > constants.js`
`cat components/SnowflakeApp1.js snowflakedata.js components/SnowflakeApp2.js > components/SnowflakeApp.js`


Compile the application:
`yarn export`

This will put a static version of the site in `out/`.

Finally, run:

`sed -i -- 's#/_next#_next#g' out/index.html`

This will remove some leading slashes that cause problems displaying the webpage.

## Future work

* Load initial data from a file, to improve flexibility.
* Add restricted job title selection and validation.
